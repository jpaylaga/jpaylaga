> ### *☕️ I turn coffee into code 💻*

💻 With over a decade of experience in software engineering, I’ve built a career around solving complex problems and delivering impactful solutions. My journey began during my college years (2011–2014) as a freelance web developer, where I crafted custom websites and applications for clients. Since transitioning into corporate roles in 2014, I’ve steadily grown into leadership positions, guiding teams and driving projects that create meaningful business outcomes.

🚀 Currently, I lead **Mabizza IT Solutions** ([mabizza.biz](https://mabizza.biz)), a software agency dedicated to delivering innovative technology solutions tailored to diverse business needs. Through this venture, I continue to design and implement scalable, high-performance systems that empower businesses to grow and adapt in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

🔍 Most recently, I focused on improving **search efficiency** at **[Incube8](https://www.incube8.sg/)**, where I optimized search systems to deliver faster, more accurate results—enhancing user experience and overall system performance. Prior to that, I led the automation of manual processes in the **local gaming industry** with **Grand Gaming Group**, pioneering technology that streamlined Small-Town Lottery operations and transformed local business workflows. Earlier in my career, I developed and maintained complex **CRM integration platforms** at **[Cazoomi](https://www.cazoomi.com/)**, enabling seamless connections between CRMs and marketing tools, saving clients valuable time and improving business efficiency.

🛠️ Technically, I bring deep expertise in **AWS** and **serverless architecture**, building scalable and efficient cloud-native solutions. I am proficient in **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **PHP**, **Java**, and frameworks like **Laravel**, **Vue**, and **React**. My database skills include **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB**, ensuring robust and reliable data handling for high-traffic systems. I also contributed to the open-source **Lesgo Serverless Framework**, reflecting my commitment to advancing cloud-based development.

🤝 Beyond technology, I excel in leading high-performing teams, fostering collaboration, and delivering mission-critical projects on time and within scope. Every challenge is an opportunity to innovate, and every project is a chance to create lasting impact.

🔥 I’m driven by a passion for building solutions that empower businesses to grow and evolve, and I’m excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
